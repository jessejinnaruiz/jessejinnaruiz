# Jesse Jinna Ruiz
## Data Engineer
<p> Pronouns: she/they </p>
<p> 👩🏽‍🎓: Barnard College, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Codeup </p>
<p> My name is Jesse J. Ruiz. I’m a data engineer and artist. I launched a career in technology after pursuing a career as a fine artist and because of this I believe in the synthesis of qualitative and quantitative questions. My other interests include writing, art, film and philosophy.</p>

<p>I have been working in the tech industry for the past 2 years and have been loving the experience of learning, applying my technical skills to real problems, and meeting and working with new and interesting people. I have worked a number of different teams. Currently, I work on a team that operationalizes machine learning models. I have also worked with a wide array of tools including Excel VBA, Hadoop, PySpark, Tableau, front end web development and Snowflake.</p>
